# Git Commands for Developers in Companies

There are several commonly used Git commands that developers in companies frequently use. Here are some of the essential Git commands:

1. `git clone`: Used to create a local copy of a remote repository on your machine.

2. `git pull`: Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository to the current branch.

3. `git push`: Uploads local commits to a remote repository.

4. `git add`: Adds files or changes to the staging area.

5. `git commit`: Records the changes to the repository with a descriptive message.

6. `git branch`: Lists, creates, or deletes branches in the repository.

7. `git checkout`: Switches between branches or restores files from a specific commit.

8. `git merge`: Integrates changes from one branch into another.

9. `git rebase`: Incorporates changes from one branch onto another branch.

10. `git stash`: Temporarily stores changes that are not ready to be committed.

11. `git log`: Displays the commit history.

12. `git status`: Shows the current state of the working directory and staging area.

These commands form the core set of Git commands used for day-to-day development tasks. However, depending on the specific workflow, branching model, and project requirements, developers may also use additional Git commands and techniques like `git cherry-pick`, `git revert`, `git tag`, and more.

It's important to note that Git is a powerful version control system with a wide range of features, and the usage of commands may vary depending on the team's practices and project requirements.
